<h2>Feature Builder {#feature-builder}</h2>
<p>Creating features can be a painstaking process. Way too much clicking. Using the features builder module will hopefully end this. There are still some kinks to work out.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to get started:</p>
<p>**Step 1:**Access the features module by going to Structure-Feature-Build.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Go to Configuration and choose a name for the prefix. The configuration path should be: sites/all/modules/features/build</p>
<p>**Step 3:**In the command line run the command:</p>
<p><code>mkdir -p /var/www/elmsln/domains/innovate/sing100/sites/all/modules/features/build</code>This creates the files where the features will be built.</p>
<p>**Step 4:**Next run the command:</p>
<p><code>chmod 777 /var/www/elmsln/domains/innovate/sing100/sites/all/modules/features/build</code>This will allow the permissions for the features module to work.</p>
<p>**Step 5:**Go to Build, and then click Enable, then select Build.</p>
<p>**Step 6:**You will see the all of the features that were just built under Content, CTools, and Configuration.</p>
<p>**Step 7:**Selecting a certain feature will allow you to view what is included in the feature, make any changes, and then download the feature.</p>
