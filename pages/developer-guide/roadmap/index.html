<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>These are some systems and functionalities on the long term roadmap with the Core development team. These have come out of community conversations as well as whiteboard sessions with the team. It is subject to change but can help inform the scope of each tool and why something lives where it does. They are also loosely in order based on how much work has been put into them and what we'd consider each at this time.</p>
<p>The Core Architecture: ELMSLN is a package deployment intended to run on its own server. There are also future plans for running "fractal networks" which span servers. The core architecture has been running relatively unmodified since Fall 2013 and is considered very stable.Status:<strong>Production</strong>
