<h1>Interact (icor / interact.elmsln) {#media}</h1>
<h2>What is it {#what-is-it}</h2>
<p>Interactive course object repository (ICOR) is a unique form of media production. It requires assembly potentially (in browser) vs being produced ahead of time. It's also potentially more varied / experimental in nature. For example, a geo-positional mapping element people can interact with. This system is less developed then the media system and provides a play space for innovation, allowing things to graduate to the media system. A past example of this was H5P which previously was included with ICOR for testing until maturing and being implemented as parts of normal development workflows.</p>
<h2>What it has {#what-it-has}</h2>
<h3>Timelines {#audio}</h3>
<p>A timeline is an interactive piece of media assembled by the user in the space</p>
<h3>Mapping</h3>
<p>Some basic support for setting points on a map and producing maps with multiple items in it</p>
