<p>Some systems in ELMS:LN are intentional spaces for creation, exploration and trying things that might be on the bleeding edge. These things don't always graduate into the primary capabilities of ELMS:LN but provide great spaces for exploring the unknown. All applications that are fully developed start here in some form on their way toward becoming sustainable innovations.</p>
